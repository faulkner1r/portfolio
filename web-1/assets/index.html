        <h2>My Assessment</h2>
        <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simploicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with necessarily large amount of data.</p>
        <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and not need to be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chuncks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather trhan attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing"of information rather htan the illumination of it.</p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <h4>Explain the difference between the alt" attribute and the title attribute.</h4>
<ul>
            <p><li>The "alt" attribute gives written description of an image in html if the image cannot be displayed for any reason. The "title" attribute shows what the image is
            to the reader or viewer as theyhover over the image. These two attributes are not interchangable.</li></p>
</ul>
        <h4>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary.</h4>
<ul>
            <p><li>There are a couple of different elements you can use when marking definitions. One is the &lt;dfn&gt; element that changes the look of the defined word. For more 
                formal definitions you can use the aria-describedby attribute. The markup for this is:</li></p>
                <br>
</ul>
    <ul>
                <p><li> &lt;span id="ff"&gt;</li></p>
                <p><li>&lt;dfn aria-describedby="ff"&gt;portfolio&lt;/dfn&gt;</li></p>
                <p><li>is a selection of a student's work (such as papers and tests) compiled over a period of time and used for assessing performance or progress.</li></p>
        <p><li>&lt;/span&gt;</li></p>
    </ul>
<br>
    <ul>
<p><li>It displays on the web like this:</p>
<p>
  <span id="ff">
    <dfn aria-describedby="ff">Portfolio</dfn>
    is a selection of a student's work (such as papers and tests) compiled over a period of time and used for assessing performance or progress.
  </span>
        </li>
</ul>
