        <h2>My Assessment</h2>
        <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simploicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with necessarily large amount of data.</p>
        <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and not need to be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chuncks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather trhan attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing"of information rather htan the illumination of it.</p>
