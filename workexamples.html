            <h3>Tech Writing Project</h3>
            <p>This first example was a project from my Technical Writing class. I was tasked with creating a recommendation document. I chose to do a recommedation on Home Alarm Systems. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bSfy3eD4Bs6HuJhNzf2wM8mBd9c3WVkjqMuBxrqsNf8/edit"alt="Click Here">Click here</a> to see project.

            <h3>Tech Writing Project</h3>
            <p>This second example was also a project from my Technical Writing Class. I was tasked with creating a presentation designed to highlight a need that could be addressed at my workplace. A pdf version of the presentation can be found <a href="Faulkner Helping the Helpdesk.pdf"> here</a>.</p>

            <P>When first learning to program, there are times that make things interesting. After first learning how to say "Hello World", create various backgrounds, 
                and make random images and numbers come onto the screen, I finally learned something I was intrigued by. The Coin Flip game, while simple, was fun for me. 
                I have recreated a similar version of this here. Using Visual Studio and C# programming, the Coin Flip game game back to life. Click on the image on the left to 
                see the code and image of the results presented in a Google Doc.

                <p>I have held many jobs over my lifetime. I began work at an early age of 13 and, from that moment on, I have held a desire to make sure I give everything I 
                have to an employer. I pride myself on my work ethic and determination. I believe having to work at such an early age while still attending school has allowed 
                me the opportunity to balance multiple tasks. This work ethic continued through a long (12 year) military career through the Army and Marines. My work ethic and 
                determination allowed me to progress through the ranks faster than my peers. This granted me many opportunities to gain and demonstrate leadership. In the military, 
                you must prove your value and ability by completing courses to ensure you can be a good leader. The lives of others can be in your hands and it must be proved
                that you are up for this challenge. While progressing through this career, I was given a difficult task; although, it was of my own decision. I was forced to balance
                work with family. With a non-traditional job, this task becomes even harder. When you do not work the typical 9-5 job, you have to 
                figure out different ways to balance your time. Spending up to 15 months at a time away from your children and spouse most times thousands of miles and many countries
                away, is extremely difficult. As my children have grown older and are growing into responsible people, I feel more and more confident that I have done a good job.</p>
